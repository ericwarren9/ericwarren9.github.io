# What is Exploratory Data Analysis?

If you are someone who is interested in becoming a [Data Scientist](https://ericwarren9.github.io/2023/08/22/First-Blog-Post.html), you have probably heard the term "exploratory data analysis" a couple of times before. But what exactly does this term mean or is there a correct process of doing this analysis correctly?

According to [the National Institute of Standards and Techology](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section1/eda11.htm), **exploratory data analysis** is an approach or philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to

* maximize insight into a data set;
* uncover underlying structure;
* extract important variables;
* detect outliers and anomalies;
* test underlying assumptions;
* develop parsimonious models; and
* determine optimal factor settings.
