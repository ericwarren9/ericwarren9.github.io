Hello everyone, my name is Eric Warren. I am a Master's Candidate in Statistics at North Carolina State University. 

My career interests include sports, finance, and healthcare analytics and I hope to become a future Data Scientist.

Some hobbies I have include:
  + Sports (I have played almost every sport imaginable).
    + Ice hockey, American football, and Lacrosse are my favorites.
  + Disc Golf (I know this is becoming a sport but more of a leisure activity for me)
  + Reading (I like to read about statistics, sports trends, history)
  + Chess (I am not very good and learning)
